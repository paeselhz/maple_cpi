## About the app

**Maple CPI** is a tool developed to allow people from different backgrounds to develop a better understanding to the currrent state of the economy in Canada, allowing generic users to grasp the information on their bills rising, while also being a tool for advanced users to build analysis, develop charts and export information related to the Canadian Consumer Price Index (CPI). The tool name is derived from a Canadian symbol, a Maple leaf, and the acronym for the main inflation index, the CPI.
